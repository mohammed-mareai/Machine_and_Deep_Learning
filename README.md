# Machine_and_Deep_Learning

This repository contains machine learning and deep learning projects using Scikit-learn and Keras libraries. It covers a variety of topics and different models. The repository includes three Jupyter Notebook files:

1. **Sklearn**: This notebook provides a general overview of the Scikit-Learn library, showcasing multiple machine learning models built with Scikit-learn. It also highlights the capabilities of Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling. This file is inspired by a course on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0B5eIE_1vpU).

2. **Machine Learning Modeling**: This notebook contains various machine learning models, including regression, classification, and clustering models using Scikit-learn. It utilizes several datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The notebook is inspired by the book *Statistics for Machine Learning* by Pratap Dangeti. [Google Books](https://books.google.co.id/books?id=C-dDDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false).

3. **Keras**: This notebook provides a guide for building deep learning models using Keras. It covers basic regression and classification models and includes detailed explanations on building Keras models.
